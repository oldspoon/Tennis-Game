# Tennis-Game


This is a game where I showcase the usage of JUnitTest and Maven technologies in Java.

The game is about Tennis where a person must score a minimum of 4 times to win the game and having more than a 2 score difference than their opponent.

1 Point is called "Love", 2 points is "15", 3 points is "30", and 4 points is "40".
When both opponents are at a Deuce (equal score), a player must secure Advantage by leading with 1 point more and scoring again to win.

The program runs JUnitTest to check 14 conditions if the program runs successfully. It uses the Maven framework to initialize the project.
